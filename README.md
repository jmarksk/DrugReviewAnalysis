# Background Information

A hospital or insurance provider is interested in efficiently extracting numeric ratings from patients' written review.  To this end we build a model using labelled, numerically, patient reviews. 

# Data exploration

The data comes from Drugs.com and is accessed through UCI's website.

Ratings are not normally distributed. Counts are highest at the worst and best ratings. 

# Data Understanding/Preprocessing

Creating the tf-idf matrix.

# Data modelling

- Baseline model (TF-IDF) with linear regression

- Decision Tree regression models

- Word embedding models.

## Conclusions

- Deployment for ‘rating extraction’ from written review.

- Gather insights on how patients rate drugs.
